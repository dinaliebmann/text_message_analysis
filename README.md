# text_message_analysis

This project was a gift for my boyfriend on our third anniversary. It includes most of our iMessage data (not all three years were collected due to data issues), and is an altered version of u/sumisel's [post on reddit](https://reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/8br5hq/made_this_for_my_bf_on_our_one_year_anniversary_oc/), with her code located [here](https://github.com/sumisel/ChatStats/blob/master/chat_stats.R).

Final result:
